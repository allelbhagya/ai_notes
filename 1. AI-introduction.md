## Search: Informed and uninformed

- search techniques are universal problem solving methods, rational agents or problem solving agents.

properties of search algorithms:

- completeness: it should guarantee to return a solution if at least any solution exists for any random input
- optimal: guaranteed to be the best solution(lowest path cost) among all other solutions.
- minimal space and time complexity

Uninformed/Blind Search

- BFS
- DFS
- Uniform cost search

Informed Search

- Best first search
- A* search

### Uninformed Search

- does not contain any domain knowledge such as closeness, the location of goal
- operates in brute force way
- examines each node of the tree until it achieves the goal node

### Informed search / Heuristic search

- algorithm uses domain knowledge
- problem information is available which can guide the search
- finds solution more efficiently than an uninformed search strategy

## Uninformed

### Breadth first search

- traverses a tree or graph
- searches breadth wise in a tree or graph
- starts searching from the root, expands all successor node at the current level before moving to next
- uses QUEUE

$O(V^2$) when adjacency matrix and O(V+E) at adjacency list

### Depth first search

- uses STACK
- starts from root node and follows each path to its greatest depth node before moving to the next path

$O(V^2$) when adjacency matrix and O(V+E) at adjacency list

### Uniform cost search

- used for weighted tree
- goal is to find a path to a goal node with lowest cumulative path - optimal
- node expansion is based on path cost
- USES priority queue
- high priority to minimum cost
- uses backtracking
- takes minimum cost to go to start to end node

## Informed

### Best First Search

$O(n  *log n)$

- using priority queue
- OPEN, CLOSED - two priority queue
- priority queue based on their heuristic value

g(n) : path distance

h(n) : estimate to goal

f(n) : combined huersitics g(n) + f(n)

> 
> 
> 1. Create 2 empty lists: OPEN and CLOSED
> 2. Start from the initial node (say N) and put it in the ‘ordered’ OPEN list
> 3. Repeat the next steps until the GOAL node is reached
>     1. If the OPEN list is empty, then EXIT the loop returning ‘False’
>     2. Select the top node N in OPEN list and move it to the CLOSED list
>     3. If N is a GOAL node, then move the node to the Closed list and exit the loop returning ‘True’. The solution can be found by backtracking the path
>     4. If N is not the GOAL node, expand node N to generate the neighbour nodes linked to node N and add all those to the OPEN list
>     5. Reorder the nodes in the OPEN list in ascending order according to an evaluation function f(n)

### A* search (admissible guarantee for optimal solution)

$f(N) = g(N) + h(N)$

g(N) : actual cost from start node to N

h(n) : estimated cost from N to GOAL node

step by step choosing the minimum value for combined heuristic
